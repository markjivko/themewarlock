People nowadays can't identify with him closely as a member of their own generation, and he isn't yet historical.","When I was 12 years old, someone took me to see Martha Graham. It was nothing like what I thought of as serious dancing and even then I knew I was having a great experience. It was as if somebody was moving through space like no one ever did before.","My assignment is what every writer's assignment is: tell the truth of his own time.","I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love.","It's funny to be a critic.","All good criticism should be judged the way art is.

R. Ammons":["Probably all the attention to poetry results in some value, though the attention is more often directed to lesser than to greater values.","Everything is discursive opinion instead of direct experience.","Poetry leads us to the unstructured sources of our beings, to the unknown, and returns us to our rational, structured selves refreshed.","Even if you walk exactly the same route each time - as with a sonnet - the events along the route cannot be imagined to be the same from day to day, as the poet's health, sight, his anticipations, moods, fears, thoughts cannot be the same.","The poet exposes himself to the risk. All that has been said about poetry, all that he has learned about poetry, is only a partial assurance.","Once every five hundred years or so, a summary statement about poetry comes along that we can't imagine ourselves living without.","If we ask a vague question, such as, 'What is poetry?' we expect a vague answer, such as, 'Poetry is the music of words,' or 'Poetry is the linguistic correction of disorder.'","Besides the actual reading in class of many poems, I would suggest you do two things: first, while teaching everything you can and keeping free of it, teach that poetry is a mode of discourse that differs from logical exposition.","That's a wonderful change that's taken place, and so most poetry today is published, if not directly by the person, certainly by the enterprise of the poet himself, working with his friends.","I am grateful for - though I can't keep up with - the flood of articles, theses, and textbooks that mean to share insight concerning the nature of poetry."],"Margaret Sanger":["War, famine, poverty and oppression of the workers will continue while woman makes life cheap.

Early in the morning on the 1st of July the conflict began.","Let a nation's fervent thanks make some amends for the toils and sufferings of those who survive.","Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army."],"Robert Morgan":["I did not have a very literary background. I came to poetry from the sciences and mathematics, and also through an interest in Japanese and Chinese poetry in translation.","The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.","Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.","I learned to impersonate the kind of person that talks about poetry. It comes from teaching, I think.","The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.","In the later books I am much more at home in the use of language to describe things. I had never thought of that until a critic pointed that out.","Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.","What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.","The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.","I think that it's more likely that in my 60s and 70s I will be writing poetry rather than fiction.","Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.","A poem in form still has to have voice, gesture, a sense of discovery, a metaphoric connection, as any poetry does.","Pound's translation of Chinese poetry was maybe the most important thing I read. Eliot a little bit later.","Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.","Philip Larkin has a tough honesty and sense of humor that I find irresistible, as a contemporary poet.","I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.","The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.","Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.","I don't think the creative writing industry has helped American poetry.","You have to really dive deep back into yourself and get rid of so much modern analytical categorization. It's one of the great things poetry does.","The great watershed of modern poetry is French, more than English.","If a poem is not memorable, there's probably something wrong. One of the problems of free verse is that much of the free verse poetry is not memorable.","One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.","I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.","I don't think poetry is something that can be taught. We can encourage young writers, but what you can't teach them is the very essence of poetry."],"Mira Nair":["Creative freedom is an imperative for me, but it doesn't really exist in a Hollywood game.","My family is almost exactly like the one in 'Monsoon Wedding'. We are very open, fairly liberal, loud people.","I often begin movies with music in my head it's a very important dimension to me. Not just the music itself, but how to use music in film: when and how and subtlety. I don't like to be too sweet in my stories, and I like the abrasive clang, the contrasting of sounds and cultures.","In America, we have so many movies and so much media about the Islamic world, the sub-continental world, but it's not a conversation, it's a monologue. It's always from one point of view. 'If we don't tell our own stories, no one will tell them' is my mantra.","I am at home in many cultures. I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people. I do things that I want to do.","We have three generations at home, including my father-in-law. I keep a very low profile, and a lot of things I do are very much with the family in mind. I have actually made films with the family around me.","We have to realize only in communication, in real knowledge, in real reaching out, can there be an understanding that there's humanity everywhere, and that's what I'm trying to do.","I think films have to reach people and really grab them. That's what I hope to do when I make a film - to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.","It's only at this age that I can say the word 'art' without flinching.","Marriage of attraction is a gamble anyway, so you might as well marry into a family that is similar to your own, and make that much less of an adjustment. But the 'love marriage', as it is called, is equally common in India now. But it would be interesting to do a comparison of what would work better. Marriage is hard work, and it is a gamble.","New York City is home to so many people from so many places and the uniqueness of it is that you never feel a foreigner. English is almost hardly ever heard in the subway. In fact, it's weird."],"Lord John Russell":["A proverb is the wisdom of many and the wit of one."],"Arthur Keith":["Under no stretch of imagination can war be regarded as an ethical process yet war, force, terror, and propaganda were the evolutionary means employed to weld the German people into a tribal whole.","In a tribal organization, even in time of peace, service to tribe or state predominates over all self seeking in war, service for the tribe or state becomes supreme, and personal liberty is suspended.","My personal conviction is that science is concerned wholly with truth, not with ethics."],"Bill Owens":["Families are the tie that reminds us of yesterday, provide strength and support today, and give us hope for tomorrow. No government, no matter how well-intentioned, or well-managed, can provide what our families provide.","Leadership is an active role 'lead' is a verb. But the leader who tries to do it all is headed for burnout, and in a powerful hurry.","Freedom is contagious. That's why despots fear it so much.","Leadership offers an opportunity to make a difference in someone's life, no matter what the project.","True leadership lies in guiding others to success. In ensuring that everyone is performing at their best, doing the work they are pledged to do and doing it well.","We know that, when it comes to technology and the economy, if you're not constantly moving forward, then - without a doubt - you're moving backwards.","Actions, not words, are the ultimate results of leadership."],"Hugh Hefner":["If you let society and your peers define who you are, you're the less for it.","In my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined a sweeter life.","I was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s. I admired Gene Harlow and such, which probably explains why, since the end of my marriage, I've dated nothing but a succession of blondes.","I always say now that I'm in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.","My folks were raised pure prohibitionist. They were very good people, with high moral standards - but very repressed.

The most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries.","Nature, who for the perfect maintenance of the laws of her general equilibrium, has sometimes need of vices and sometimes of virtues, inspires now this impulse, now that one, in accordance with what she requires.","The imagination is the spur of delights... all depends upon it, it is the mainspring of everything now, is it not by means of the imagination one knows joy? Is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise?","What is more immoral than war?","Happiness is ideal, it is the work of the imagination.","Your body is the church where Nature asks to be reverenced.","Destruction, hence, like creation, is one of Nature's mandates.","Happiness lies neither in vice nor in virtue but in the manner we appreciate the one and the other, and the choice we make pursuant to our individual organization.","The primary and most beautiful of Nature's qualities is motion, which agitates her at all times, but this motion is simply a perpetual consequence of crimes, she conserves it by means of crimes only.","The more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success.","There is no more lively sensation than that of pain its impressions are certain and dependable, they never deceive as may those of the pleasure women perpetually feign and almost never experience."],"Phyllis Diller":["My recipe for dealing with anger and frustration: set the kitchen timer for twenty minutes, cry, rant, and rave, and at the sound of the bell, simmer down and go about business as usual.","Most children threaten at times to run away from home.

You're not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.","Choreography is amazing. I'm still a dancer, yet I transitioned into choreography then as a Creative Director. All of these creative elements are brought out of being a dancer.

Written goals provide clarity. By documenting your dreams, you must think about the process of achieving them.","Discipline is based on pride, on meticulous attention to details, and on mutual respect and confidence.
